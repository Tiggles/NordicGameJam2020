HELP_SHOP = [[
    You run a small potion shop in the city.
    In your opening hours every day from 10:00 to 18:00, customers will come to with their problems.
    To the left you can see your shop, and to the right you can see the conversations and inventory.
    If you have the potion in stock, you can sell it, but the faster the better.
    If you don't have it in stock, you can tell the customer to come back a week from the day, but only once.
    Otherwise, you can decline.

    The better you do, the higher the rate of customers will become.
